# UPS
# My React Native App

This mobile application is built with React Native and TypeScript. It uses libraries such as react-native-maps, Apollo Client, and Expo. The app features a login screen, a customer screen, and an orders screen, and it communicates with the backend via a GraphQL API managed by StepZen.

## Features

1. **Login Screen:** This is the initial screen where users can input their credentials to log in to the app.

2. **Customer Screen:** Upon successful login, users are directed to the customer screen where they can interact with various customer-related features.

3. **Orders Screen:** Users can manage their orders on the orders screen.

## Technologies
